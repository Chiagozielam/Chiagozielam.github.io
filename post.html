                <p>Learning a new programming language can be a challenging experience especially if it’s the 
                    first language you’ve ever learned. Sometime it’s easy to skip some things and hurriedly try 
                    to get ahead. I know the feeling… Sometimes you already have an idea in mind which you can’t wait
                    to start working on.

                <h1 class="flow-text post-main">WHAT THE HELL IS ORGANISED LEARNING???</h1>
                <p>
                    In this context, I would define it as the process of learning accordingly, that is to say 
                    that you do not skip steps but learn following a scheme;
                    Think about this, what if you failed to learn your ABC? How would you have known to spell 
                    (or at least understand what you’re spelling). Your teacher would not have started teaching you 
                    five(5) letter words without taking you through two, three, and four. The basics are sometime boring, 
                    getting to learn many other things before you arrive at what you feel you want to learn, is frustrating, 
                    but try as much as possible to follow through, because these thing are most likely the building blocks you 
                    would need in your learning curve.
                    Have a scheme, Personally I didn’t have money to pay for online courses when I started out 
                    (I’m still a learner though.. don’t be confused ), but one tool I made use of was using free pdf 
                    materials from the internet. I discovered that my learning became organized because I was following a proper 
                    scheme, introducing new concepts to me when I’ve gotten to the stage to handle that concept.
                    
                </p>

                <h1 class="flow-text post-main">HOW TO USE YOUTUBE TUTORIALS</h1>
                <p>
                        Don’t opt for watching random tutorials on YouTube. Instead watch those videos accordingly. 
                        Personally I take topic from my pdf books and follow accordingly with youtube videos. 
                        That way, you’re syncing your pdf textbook with a video experience(that other online 
                        course are you looking for better than this???).
                        .
                        Note: It’s not bad to take a little leap at times out of curiousity, but make sure you get back on track.
                        I hope this helps.
